Android/iOS Game for pantomime


An application created using [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/ "NativeScript Homepage").

The application is a simple game where a player has to guess a word by pantomime under time pressure.

## Game

- Create and edit decks

   A user can create a deck, which is a list of words
   
- Play a game with a chosen deck and a set timer

   The game is played under time pressure. The user will hold the phone in front of his head, showing the display to the other players, but not himself.  
   The other players are using pantomime to explain the word to the player with the phone.  
   If the player guesses the word correctly, he can shake the phone upwards to get more time, a point and a new word.
   If the player thinks he won't be able to guess the word he can shake the phone downwards, to get a new word, but without getting a point and (if chosen by the players) lose some time.
   
## Technology

This app is fully built using NativeScript, e.g. TypeScript and Angular to create a native application that is able to run on both Android and iOS systems.
